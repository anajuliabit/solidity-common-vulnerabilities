Weighted Average: If some classes have fewer occurrences, a weighted average could provide a more balanced view.

Median: Unlike the mean, the median is less sensitive to outliers and could give a better central tendency measure.

Bootstrapping: This involves resampling your existing dataset with replacement to create 'new' samples. This can help in estimating the distribution for each class.

Confidence Intervals: Calculate confidence intervals for each class's average number of auditors to understand the range in which the true average likely exists.

Bayesian Methods: If you have prior beliefs or additional data, Bayesian methods can help improve estimates.

Normalization: Consider normalizing the number of auditors by the total number of bugs in each category. This might reveal the 'difficulty' of finding a bug in each class, independent of how many bugs are in the class.
