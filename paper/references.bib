Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

To make the most of this potential, its practitioners must gain a rigorous understanding of its intricacies, as must information systems (IS) researchers. Against this background, this study uses a multivocal literature review to capture the state of research in DeFi. Thereby, we (1) present a consolidating definition of DeFi as we (2) analyze, synthesize, and discuss the current state of knowledge in the field of DeFi. We do so while adapting the blockchain research framework proposed by (Risius and Spohrer, Business \& Information Systems Engineering 59:385\textendash 409, 2017). Furthermore, we (3) identify gaps in the literature and indicate future research directions in DeFi. Even though our findings highlight several shortcomings in DeFi that have prevented its widespread adoption, our literature review shows a large consensus on DeFi's many promising features and potential to complement the traditional financial system. To that end, this paper is presented to encourage further research to mitigate the current risks of DeFi, the payoff of which will be an enriched financial ecosystem.},

  abstract = {In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a model of computation, a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine (devised by English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing). This means that this system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets. Turing completeness is used as a way to express the power of such a data-manipulation rule set. Virtually all programming languages today are Turing-complete.  A related concept is that of Turing equivalence \textendash{}  two computers P and Q are called equivalent if P can simulate Q and Q can simulate P. The Church\textendash Turing thesis conjectures that any function whose values can be computed by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine, and therefore that if any real-world computer can simulate a Turing machine, it is Turing equivalent to a Turing machine. A universal Turing machine can be used to simulate any Turing machine and by extension the computational aspects of any possible real-world computer.To show that something is Turing-complete, it is enough to show that it can be used to simulate some Turing-complete system. No physical system can have infinite memory, but if the limitation of finite memory is ignored, most programming languages are otherwise Turing-complete.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has widely expanded due to its advantages in enhancing the business, industrial, and social ecosystems. Nevertheless, IoT infrastructure is susceptible to several cyber-attacks due to the endpoint devices' restrictions in computation, storage, and communication capacity. As such, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks pose a serious threat to the security of the IoT. Attackers can easily utilize IoT devices as part of botnets to launch DDoS attacks by taking advantage of their flaws. This paper proposes an Ethereum blockchain model to detect and prevent DDoS attacks against IoT systems. Additionally, the proposed system can be used to resolve the single points of failure (dependencies on third parties) and privacy and security in IoT systems. First, we propose implementing a decentralized platform in place of current centralized system solutions to prevent DDoS attacks on IoT devices at the application layer by authenticating and verifying these devices. Second, we suggest tracing and recording the IP address of malicious devices inside the blockchain to prevent them from connecting and communicating with the IoT networks. The system performance has been evaluated by performing 100 experiments to evaluate the time taken by the authentication process. The proposed system highlights two messages with a time of 0.012 ms: the first is the request transmitted from the IoT follower device to join the blockchain, and the second is the blockchain response. The experimental evaluation demonstrated the superiority of our system because there are fewer I/O operations in the proposed system than in other related works, and thus it runs substantially faster.},

It helps to protect the data from unauthorized access by attackers. However, all the existing advanced technologies face some issues because of their uncertainties. These technologies have some lapses to provide privacy, attack-free, transparency, reliability, and flexibility. These characteristics are essential while managing any sensitive data like educational certificates or medical certificates. Hence, we designed an Industry 5.0 based blockchain application to manage medical certificates using Remix Ethereum blockchain in this paper. This application also employs a distributed application (DApp) that uses a test RPC-based Ethereum blockchain and user expert system as a knowledge agent. The main strength of this work is the maintenance of existing certificates over a blockchain with the creation of new certificates that use logistic Map encryption cipher on existing medical certificates while uploading into the blockchain. This application helps to quickly analyze the birth, death, and sick rate as per certain features like location and year.{$<$}/p{$>$} 		{$<$}/abstract{$>$}},

  abstract = {Blockchain introduces decentralized trust in peer-to-peer networks, advancing security and democratizing systems. Yet, a unified definition for decentralization remains elusive. Our Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) seeks to bridge this gap, emphasizing quantification and methodological coherence. We've formulated a taxonomy defining blockchain decentralization across five facets: consensus, network, governance, wealth, and transaction. Despite the prevalent focus on consensus decentralization, our novel index, based on Shannon entropy, provides comprehensive insights. Moreover, we delve into alternative metrics like the Gini and Nakamoto Coefficients and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), supplemented by an open-source Python tool on GitHub. In terms of methodology, blockchain research has often bypassed stringent scientific methods. By employing descriptive, predictive, and causal methods, our study showcases the potential of structured research in blockchain. Descriptively, we observe a trend of converging decentralization levels over time. Examining DeFi platforms reveals exchange and lending applications as more decentralized than their payment and derivatives counterparts. Predictively, there's a notable correlation between Ether's returns and transaction decentralization in Ether-backed stablecoins. Causally, Ethereum's transition to the EIP-1559 transaction fee model has a profound impact on DeFi transaction decentralization. To conclude, our work outlines directions for blockchain research, emphasizing the delicate balance among decentralization facets, fostering long-term decentralization, and the ties between decentralization, security, privacy, and efficiency. We end by spotlighting challenges in grasping blockchain decentralization intricacies.},
